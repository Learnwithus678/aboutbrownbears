<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Brown bears are large, powerful animals with thick fur ranging from light to dark brown, often with a distinctive shoulder hump that gives them extra strength for digging. Their long, sharp claws and broad heads make them formidable hunters and foragers. They have an exceptional sense of smell, allowing them to detect food from great distances. Weighing anywhere from 200 to over 1,500 pounds depending on the subspecies, they are omnivores, eating plants, berries, fish, and small mammals. Brown bears are generally solitary, territorial, and hibernate during the winter months in colder regions.</p>
